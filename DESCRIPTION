Description: Nuclear Decay Data for Dosimetric Calculations from the International Commission on Radiological Protection from ICRP Publication 107. Ann. ICRP 38 (3). Eckerman, Keith and Endo, Akira 2008 <doi:10.1016/j.icrp.2008.10.004>  <http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20107>.  This is a database of the physical data needed in calculations of radionuclide-specific protection and operational quantities. The data is prescribed by the ICRP, the international authority on radiation dose standards, for estimating dose from the intake of or exposure to radionuclides in the workplace and the environment. The database contains information on the half-lives, decay chains, and yields and energies of radiations emitted in nuclear transformations of 1252 radionuclides of 97 elements.
