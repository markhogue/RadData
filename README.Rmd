# RadData <img src='man/figures/RadData.png' align="right" height="139" />

This package contains data from the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 107, Nuclear Decay Data for Dosimetric Calculations. The data sets were converted from the original to a tidy data set. The files include:

* ICRP-07.NDX The index file has 32 variables, including 31 original variables from ICRP. The 32nd variable is a derived decay_constant variable in inverse seconds, to allow activity computation without unit conversion issues.

* ICRP-07.RAD Data on the energy and yield of each radiation emitted in nuclear transformations of the radionuclide.

* rad_codes A small table providing descriptions of the codes used in ICRP-07.RAD.

* ICRP-07.BET Beta decay spectra for beta emitters.

## Installation

You can install the released version of RadData from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) (after it has been released) with:

``` r
install.packages("RadData")
```
The development version from GitHub:
 
```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("markhogue/RadData")
```

## Overview
To start using the installed package: 

```{r}
library(RadData)
```

Functions for selecting and filtering data for health physics computations will be included in the package ```radsafer```.
